				<h1>CANVAS API</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Hello. My name is Ilya and today we will talk about HTML5 canvas. HTML5 features the canvas element that
					allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.
					The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML canvas element. Among other
					things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time
					video processing.

				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>First introduced in WebKit by Apple for the macOS Dashboard, canvas has since been implemented in browsers.
					Today, all major browsers support it.</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					Canvas was initially introduced by Apple for use in their own Mac OS X WebKit component in 2004,[1] powering
					applications like Dashboard widgets and the Safari browser. Later, in 2005, it was adopted in version 1.8 of
					Gecko browsers,[2] and Opera in 2006,[3] and standardized by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working
					Group (WHATWG) on new proposed specifications for next generation web technologies.

				<h2>Canvas Element</h2>
				<canvas id="canvas-second-section"></canvas>
				<aside class="notes">
					At first sight a canvas looks like the img element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have
					the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the canvas element has only two attributes, width and height. These are
						both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified,
						the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by
						CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the
						ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.
				</aside>

			<section>
				<pre>
						<code>					
              <canvas id="canvas" width="300" height="150"></canvas>
						</code>
				</pre>
				<pre>
						<code>					
              const canvas = document.querySelector('#canvas');
              const width = canvas.width;// 300
              const height = canvas.height;// 150`
						</code>
				</pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					Know we will talking about steps to Getting Started with The Canvas.
					Our first step is to Create the canvas element — give it an id, and a width/height (HTML).
					After that we can add our base styles — for example we can -  center the canvas and add a background color
					then In JavaScript we can get your canvas element by using the id.
					And know we can Use the canvas element to get the context and use context Object to draw something

				<h2>The rendering context</h2>
				<pre>
					<code>
						const canvas = document.querySelector('#canvas');
						const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
				</code>
			</pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					The canvas element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are
					used to create and manipulate the content shown.We focus on the 2D rendering context. Other
					contexts may provide different types of rendering; for example, WebGL uses a 3D context based on OpenGL ES.
					The canvas is initially blank. To display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and
					draw on it. The canvas element has a method called getContext(), used to obtain the rendering context and its
					drawing functions. getContext() takes one parameter, the type of context. For 2D graphics, such as those
					covered by this tutorial, you specify "2d" to get a CanvasRenderingContext2D.
					The first line in the script retrieves the node in the DOM representing the canvas element by calling the
					document.getElementById() method. Once you have the element node, you can access the drawing context using its
					getContext() method.

				<h2>Drawing shapes with canvas</h2>
				<img src="./src/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
				<aside class="notes">
					Now that we have set up our canvas environment, we can get into the details of how to draw on the canvas. With canvas rendering context we can to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves,
					providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. Working with paths is essential when drawing objects onto
					the canvas and we will see how that can be done.

				<h3>The grid</h3>
				<img src="./src/canvas_default_grid.png" alt="">
				<aside class="notes">
					Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. 
					Canvas grid with a blue square demonstrating coordinates and axes.
					Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the
					top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the
					top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate
					(x,y). Also we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the
					grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Drawing rectangles</h3>
				<code>
					<pre>
						ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);
            ctx.strokeRect(x, y, width, height);
            ctx.clearRect(x, y, width, height);
					</pre>
				</code>
				<img src="./src/canvas_rect.png" alt="">
				<aside class="notes">
					Unlike SVG, canvas only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by
					lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of
					path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.
					First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:
					ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);
					ctx.strokeRect(x, y, width, height);
					ctx.clearRect(x, y, width, height);
					Each of these three functions takes the same parameters. x and y specify the position on the canvas (relative
					to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle. width and height provide the rectangle's size.
				</aside>

				<h3>Drawing paths</h3>
				<p>
					beginPath()<br>
					closePath()<br>
					stroke()<br>
					fill()<br>
				</p>
				<img src="./src/canvas_smiley.png" alt="">
				<aside class="notes">
					Now let's look at paths. A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different
					shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed. To
					make shapes using paths, we take some extra steps:
					beginPath()<br>
					closePath()<br>
					stroke()<br>
					fill()
					First, you create the path.
					Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path.
					Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it.
					The first step to create a path is to call the beginPath(). Internally, paths are stored as a list of
					sub-paths (lines, arcs, etc.) which together form a shape. Every time this method is called, the list is reset
					and we can start drawing new shapes.

				<h2>Canvas example</h2>
				<img src="./src/present.jpg" alt="">
				<aside class="notes">
					Now on the screen you can see examples of different works written using canvas api. Each of these examples is drawn using a 2d context and basic elementary shape drawing methods. Canvas is a very interesting and deep topic for drawing with Javascript. I hope you will be interested in how to draw on canvas.
